                    <h1>Teacher Samnieng</h1>
                    <img src="{% static 'event/Vutha.jpg' %}" class='img-responsive'>
                    <p>My name is Samnieng. I am 27 years old. I have four siblings (three brothers and one sister). I am the oldest child in my family. My father is a landmine victim. He can’t work well. Throughout my childhood, I had to work and help my father’s work. I used to work at a construction site when I needed some money to support my studies. I started learning English when I was in high school. It was very difficult for me because I was an adult who studied with children. Life was not easy during that time. I had to work hard to earn money by myself. There were also a lot of people in my family and my mother could not support my brothers and me very well. Sometimes I had no money to pay for my English school. I had to beg my English teacher to excuse me from paying the school fees for one or two months. After I graduated from high school, I was happy but I was also hopeless because I had no money to study at university. I tried to apply for scholarships from universities in my province, but I didn’t get any. I felt so hopeless with my life. Finally, one of my friends told me about scholarship programs at Dewey International University. I passed a test at Dewey and paid one hundred dollars per year. Dewey is where I met Teacher Neong, Teacher Phyrom, and Teacher Sarem.</p>
                    <p>When I was at university, I wanted to work as a businessman because I thought that being rich could change someone’s life. I decided to work in a private school, but I felt so hopeless because they cared only about rich students and not about the quality of education. At that time, I decided to stop working in that private school and then started to work for an NGO. I thought that working in the NGO would let me help the poor, but in fact, it didn’t. There were many corrupt NGOs in Cambodia that only wanted to get more money from foreigners. I was stressed because this was different from my goal, which was to help the poor. During that time, Teacher Noeng talked to me about TASSEL. I trusted Teacher Noeng because he was my classmate.</p>
                    <p> I have been working with TASSEL for 5 years and am still very happy with TASSEL because I can help more poor people. TASSEL’s specific mission is very different from what I know of other NGOs. TASSEL teachers are like my brothers and sisters. They always help me when I have a problem, they always motivate me when I feel hopeless, and they always show me what is good and what is bad. TASSEL students are cute and good students. They respect and listen to the teachers. They study to work hard everyday. I feel so happy when I teach TASSEL students. They always motivate me to work harder and harder. They are a good next generation for Cambodia. The TASSEL program is good. All the teachers must train before they teach their students. Some of them are allowed to train with foreign teachers. TASSEL focuses on the quality of education, That is why all the teachers train every day with foreign teachers and Khmer leaders. TASSEL’s love is the most important thing in transforming people’s hearts. I love the way TASSEL explains to the students and I hope in the future all children and people will love and help each other. Finally, TASSEL is the best organization that can help poor people and change their hearts. I hope all foreigners will continue to help and support us forever.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Vanna</h1>
                    <p>My name is Hut Vanna. I’m from Cambodia. I was born in Siem Reap Province, Kralanh District. My birthday is on September 2nd. I have five siblings in my family: four brothers and one sister. Unfortunately, eight years ago, when I was 18, my older brother—the fifth child— drowned. So, now I have only four siblings. My life has been full of struggles and challenges. My father passed away when I was only 6 months old. I remember when I was 7 years old, my mum played an important role among the 6 of us children. She worked tirelessly for us; she started a small shop to sell fish and different kinds of vegetables in order to earn money to support us and provide us the opportunity to study in primary school. Realizing the burden that our mum carried, my brothers, sister, and I also worked extremely hard. We often went to rice fields to catch fish to sell. I was always so happy when I caught lots of fish. Some of my favorite foods when I was younger were crickets, snakes, snails, and spiders; I loved to eat them the most.</p>
                    <p>When I turned ten years old, my mum had no ability to help us anymore due to her illness. My older brothers moved to Thailand to work as construction workers and my older sister moved to a rural area called Samlot, where the Khmer Rouge ended, and she took me along with her. My sister and I got there in 2004. We both stayed with my aunt, who was a former Khmer Rouge soldier. She was very kind to me. However, life was very difficult in Samlot. My sister and I worked hard on the farm; we grew green beans, peanuts, and cassavas to earn our living. However, unluckily, a big flood completely damaged my sister’s crops one year. Having no other way to continue paying the money we owed to microfinance companies annually, I decided that I needed to drop out of ninth grade and move to Thailand to earn money. Once there, I stayed with my older brother who was married with two children. My job was to sell water and sweep trash around parking lots near the Khmer-Thai border. I worked very hard there, and I was able to send some money to my sister and my mum every month.</p>
                    <p>Two years later, I had to make a decision on whether or not I should go back to school the following year. After long contemplation, I realized that education was necessary for my life, so I asked my sister if I could restart my ninth grade. She agreed to my request, but she struggled to earn enough to help me achieve my goal. After I finished 9th grade, I went to Battambanng to continue high school education. After I graduated from high school in 2015, I applied for a Scholarship at Dewey International University. Fortunately, I got a full-ride scholarship. At that time I felt relieved because I didn’t have to pay for the school fees. When I was a freshman, I took time to work in catering at a restaurant. I did not only serve food, but also cooked for the customers. That’s why I am good at cooking now. I worked for that restaurant for one and a half years, but I later quit that job because the shop owner required me to work from 5PM - 1AM  every day, which was impossible for me because I needed more time to study on weekends. Therefore, soon after, I began working for a hotel in Battambang city for one year. I had a lot of responsibilities, but I loved my job because the owner taught me many things. While I was working at the hotel, I heard from two friends—Teacher Dalin and Teacher Sakana—  about TASSEL.</p>
                    <p>After I got to know what TASSEL was about, I became very interested and quickly applied to become an English teacher at TASSEL. I have been with TASSEL for one year now, and TASSEL has transformed me. TASSEL gives me love and teaches me to share love with others.  TASSEL not only loves the poor in Cambodia but also helps them. Honestly speaking, the TASSEL teachers are extremely kind to me. They have taught me from their heart. I can’t believe that such kind human beings exist. To me, TASSEL plays an important role in saving lives.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Noeng</h1>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Noeng Oeurn. I was born in 1985 in a province called Kom Pong Cham shortly after the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge waged a terrible genocide that killed 20% of Cambodia’s people; many people in my village, including many of my relatives had been killed. I have eight siblings - four brothers and three sisters. I was the third child in the family because two of my siblings died. They both died from lack of nutrition just before I was born because there were no doctors. My mother was so sad that she did not tell me this until I was 11 years old. I would also get sick 2-3 times a year from the lack of food and medicine. There is still not enough nutrition or medicine today, and many children get sick and die when they are very young.</p>
                    <p>I started to work when I was 7 years old. I took care of the buffalos and also worked in the rice fields. It was a dangerous job. Once I fell off one of the buffalos and my teeth went through my face. When I turned 12 years old, I was finally able to start school as a first grader. As a student, I loved to study; however, when I was in the fifth grade, I had to stop school because I had to work more at the farm and with the buffaloes. I was 16 when I became a monk because in the pagodas they teach you many things. At 22 years old, I had to quit being a monk because I needed to get a job to pay for food. I studied computers and got a high school degree when I was 25, and this is when I decided to change my life. I had been hungry for 10 years, and thought I would probably die young because I did not have enough food to eat. I thought that before I die, I must do some good actions. I decided not to look for a job to help myself, but to help the poor people. I moved to a village to teach English to poor children and received no salary but it was okay.</p>

                    <h4>Why did I choose to teach English for my good actions?</h4>
                    <p>I chose to teach as my good action because English is SO important for the children of Cambodia. Without it, the children will not be able to finish high school or university because many of the textbooks are written in English. Furthermore, in the countryside, nobody comes to help the poor children learn English.</p>
                    <h4>Why I have chosen to work with TASSEL?</h4>
                    <p>I have chosen to work with TASSEL because I want to help poor people. I want to change this country through TASSEL. I completely understand the situation for poor families and I do not want future generations to suffer with their lives. Children can learn so much from TASSEL; they have a chance to become fluent in English and get a better education. Once the children receive an education, my country will change.</p>
                    <h4>What is the goal of my life?</h4>
                    <p>The goal of my life is to share the truest love to the poor that do not have love. I want the people in my Kingdom of Wonder to receive the truest love. Almost everyone in Cambodia has a similar life to me. They are poor, they want an education, but do not have the opportunities. Through TASSEL’s support, I, and many others, are able to achieve our dream of being educated and helping others like us. With help from TASSEL, I believe we can change my country. I am so happy to work with all the foreign teachers who have been helping TASSEL.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Phyrom</h1>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Thea Souphyrom. I was born in Prey Kri village, Chol Kiri district, Kampong Chhnang province. This village is in a remote area along Tenle Sab River. I have four siblings in total. In my family, I am the only person who graduated from college. My brothers and sister had to stop their studies before university because we are from an extremely poor family. They decided to quit their schools at grade 4, grade 5, grade 6 and grade 7 in order to help work to support my family. I grew up with a lot of hardships. Most of my childhood was not sleeping in my tiny house but was sleeping in a jungle,  in a rice field, on a riverbank, and on a fishing boat with my father and my brothers. Do you know why? I went to school in the morning but I worked for the rest of the day despite being just a child at that time. I remembered one day my father and I almost died in a river when there was a big rainstorm. My youngest brother almost died in a jungle because he was bitten by a poisonous snake and it took three hours to get to the hospital. My second younger brother was about to drown to death while he was fishing with my parents. I used to drink dirty water in puddles. We could eat enough as we often cooked just a little rice with plant root.</p>
                    <p>With the support and sacrifices made by my family, I was so lucky to graduate from college. After graduation, I worked in other private schools to earn a living and support my parents and brothers. Before I joined TASSEL, I only worked hard so that I could earn a lot of money.  However, after I joined TASSEL, I completely changed my thinking. Day by day, the situations I encountered while I was teaching and doing home visits made me think about my childhood. The situations the students in TASSEL have undergone are almost as horrible as my situation 15 to 20 years ago. There are a lot of sad people and children who need a lot of help. I really want to change this. Since I am from a poor family, I understand how much difficulty the poor are in. I think TASSEL is the right place to work in to help change these horrible situations. I have hope because I see the change in the lives of these kids. I am so thankful that I was given a chance to be part of TASSEL. I love TASSEL and I will give my best to help bring happiness into the lives of the less fortunate.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Malaya</h1>
                    <p>My name is Malaya, and I am one of the Khmer Teachers who teaches in Banan Village. I stay in Banan during the week teaching around 70 students who are in levels three and five. I am 24 years old. I have been a part of TASSEL for almost 4 years now. When I was young, I was taught the English alphabets by my father at home. However, my father’s English skills was very limited so I did not study much besides some easy words such as apple, pen, dog etc. There was a very good English school in my province that most people went to. The school fee was not very expensive at that time and was around 7US dollars a month, but it was still a lot for people who did not earn much. All my neighbors went to that English school, and they paid extra for the school bus to pick them up every day. I watched them get on the van daily, and told my parents I wanted to study English over there too. I told them I will ride my own bike as long as I could study there. I did not get to go to that English school until I was in fifth grade and my father had to sell some chickens in order to pay the fees. I remember being very excited when I got my first English text book that my aunt bought me. I still remember the first word that I learn which was ‘ear’, and also my first English teacher at that school. Her name was Sana and she was a big part of why I decided to become an English teacher.</p>
                    <p>When I was a sophomore, I was already teaching at a private school in Battambang, but one day Joji came to my university and presented TASSEL to us. He said he was looking for English teachers to teach poor children in rural parts of Cambodia. He talked about what TASSEL was and what they did. When I heard TASSEL’s main goal, which was providing English Education free of charge to poor children, it reminded me of myself when I was young and desperate to study English but could not. I thought to myself that at that time I wish there had been an organization like that at my village as well, so I decided to join TASSEL. I soon fell in love with the children in Banan. The students in this village have so much potential in them despite being so poor. They have big dreams but struggle to achieve them because they of their poverty. The public schools only provide 1-2 hours of English session a week to the middle and high school students. It is clearly not enough and, in addition to that, the unqualified teachers don’t really care about the students. Thankfully, we have TASSEL to fill in that gap. Our Khmer teachers were in similar situations when they were young, hence they are very passionate about teaching now. They work so hard to make sure the students get what they deserve: good quality education. I have been here for four years now and I have seen so much improvement in our students’ English knowledge. Many students have come from knowing nothing to being able to speak English pretty well in such a short time. That is what keeps me and other teachers going. The impact that TASSEL has had in these children’s lives is very important and I believe it will change Cambodia one day and maybe it already is.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Sakana</h1>
                    <p>My name is Sakana. I was born in 1963, and I am 26 years-old. I have four sisters. When I was five years old my three year old brother drowned. Losing him caused my parents and I a lot of sadness. When I was 6 years old I started first grade. I studied at Snoeng primary school. At the time my family was very poor, we had food in the morning, but rarely in the evening.</p>
                    <p>When I was in grade 11 I went to Thailand to start working as a construction worker. My job was to fix roads in Thailand, and I ended up working there for three months because I needed to help my family. Unfortunately, my boss did not pay me, so I went back to Cambodia. After returning I started twelfth grade, which was were I first discovered TASSEL. One day I met a person who was very kind and friendly, he was Teacher Joji. I asked him if I could be a TASSEL teacher and he said yes.</p>
                    <p>I have been working with TASSEL for four years. I believe that TASSEL is a very good organization in the for the poor in cambodia. TASSEL not only teaches English to poor children, but it also provides other forms of help for the children. TASSEL has been a great opportunity, I love teaching the kids and I understand their situations because my family is also poor. The students do not have money to attend private schools, but they can attend TASSEL which is a school in the countryside. The students can learn English without having to pay and they are taught by so many kind and friendly foreign teachers who teach English to the children over Vsee every year. Moreover, these teachers visit my country every summer. They give clothes to the kids, medicine to the old people, and they teach English to children. The foreign TASSEL teachers always care, love, and share that love with the Cambodians. I strongly believe that Cambodia will change because we have the kindest people helping us, and we can be better with English education.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Sovannarith</h1>
                    <p>Hello, my name’s Sea Sovannarith. I am 34 years old. I was born in a very poor family in the countryside with seven siblings. I remember some unforgettable stories which happened to me in my childhood. I experienced a lot of difficulties in studying and living. Following the encouragement of our relatives, my friends and I would travel about two hours to go to school every day. I would remind myself of my grandparents’ words that only education can help me to get a good job one day. I went to school by boat because I lived on the riverside of the river Tonle Sap. Whenever it rained on the way home, I had to sit on the boat with my wet uniform on until I got home. Most of my friends eventually dropped out because they needed to find food to support their families. I remember, my sister and I worked every day, earning only $3 per day. There are so many unfortunate things that I can’t even begin to describe everything here.</p>
                    <p>In 2018, I joined TASSEL as a teacher. I was asked to teach in Jeepan. You might be wondering, why am I still with TASSEL? There are so many reasons that I want to talk about, but the main reason is that I felt very shocked and ashamed when I saw so many foreigners coming to help Khmer people. Since I experienced the difficulty of living here, I want to help change my country by teaching English. This is my second year with TASSEL and I know that I can help so many poor students in the countryside. I don’t want the next generation to be as poor as I was. TASSEL gives me a great chance to join and help out others in my community. TASSEL teaches me how to transform my heart to be loving, and how to share our happiness with others who don’t even have enough to eat or to study. I hope that, through TASSEL, I can do more for poor children in the countryside. I would like to thank the foreigner teachers who give the poor children great hope and warmth to have a better future one day.</p>

Let me tell all of you about my life before I joined TASSEL organization as a teacher. I was a farmer's child who lived in a rural area. I didn’t have enough food to eat when I was a child, and sometimes, I wanted to quit school because of my family’s situation. My parents said that they would help me through school with the aid of their money even though they were really poor. Unfortunately, my parents did not earn any money while I was in junior high school. I thought about ways to help my parents, and I decided to quit school for a while in order to earn money by pulling cassavas. After some time, I went back to school. I’m going to confess that I was not good in school because of the lack of food, money, love, and time to study.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, teacher Joji and teacher Noeng went to visit and interviewed me about my family’s situation. Upon having the interview, teacher Joji and teacher Noeng decided to support me to study in TASSEL’s school and another school. I am really grateful to teacher Joji and Noeng, who are important people of the TASSEL organization. I am also thankful to teacher Helen, who used to be my sponsor before I could support myself. She always supported me with my school payment and others fees. As a result, I now have the ability to help the poor in my country. So, I decided to join the TASSEL organization as a teacher. I appreciate helping poor people with the aid of the TASSEL organization as a teacher. I strongly believe that TASSEL will change their lives. The TASSEL organization is the bright bridge to a better road ahead for the poor students and poor people. Thank you very much.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Vutha</h1>
                    <p>My name is Vutha. I was born in 1995 and am 25 years old. I am an English teacher for TASSEL an organization of Cambodia. I have been working with TASSEL for almost four years. I have only one brother. His name is Vuthy and he is 20 years old. He was a good student, often getting number one in his English class. Unfortunately, my family could not afford money to support us, so he decided to drop out when he was in ninth grade. He also used to go and work in Poi Pet for about six months to support my family. We live in Preas Srae Village, Snoeng Commune, Banan District, Battambang Province.</p>
                    <p>My family and I are farmers. When I was younger we lived happily and worked very hard in our farm almost every day. Everyone was helpful. When I was seven years old I started first grade but not until I was ten years old did I become a grade-three student. During this time I was not a good student and I would also get tortured from my teacher. In addition, I sometimes failed the exams and I repeated grade three because I did not have much time to study at home. I spent most of the time helping my parents with work, such as taking care of the cows, plowing, harvesting, catching crabs, snails, fish and so on. Also at night, I had to go into the forest to find food for my family, like shooting mice, birds, and snakes; plus I did think that education was important. Due to my father wanting me to be educated, he would teach me every night. Furthermore, he also taught me how to help my family and other people. Because of him my studies became better and better.</p>
                    <p>When I finished the ninth grade, my parents were afraid that they were going to spend a lot of money to support my learning. They decided to send me to the orphanage in Nor Rea pagoda in Battambang province about 25 kilometers from my homeland to continue. Before the public school program started, I moved and stayed there for a month and my parents would often visit me. They were so sad because there were many kids in the orphanage. I was not eating enough so they again decided to bring me back and send me to stay in Sampov pagoda which is about 10 kilometers from my house. The school was just a ten minute walk from the pagoda. I studied Khmer at Hun Sen Phom Sampov High School and English at AES School. When I was in twelve grade, I became an English teacher for AES School. After I graduated from high school, I found out about TASSEL and decided to apply. I had a chance to be part of TASSEL in 2015. At that time I was so happy because I could earn some money to support and finish my university education. I could not believe my life was better because of my parents, especially my father.</p>
                    <p>To me, the reason why I myself decided to join TASSEL was because TASSEL is an organization which has been working to serve the poor children and old people in rural areas without discriminating. I have found that the TASSEL Organization has been providing good quality English programs to the kids in the rural areas. Nowadays we are helping in five villages (1. Battambang Province, 2. Bannan District, 3. Snoeng Commune, 4. Kom Ping Pouy Village, 5. Plov Meas Commune) and we are going to start a new program in Som Lot District which is the poorest and the most horrible area. Besides teaching English to the poor kids, TASSEL has been offering some rice and medicines to the poor families and helping sick people by sending them to the hospitals in the rural areas.</p>
                    <p>I am so happy to do what I do to see people smile. I have had my own desire to help develop my own country since I was at my secondary school. Through my own experiences, I knew no English until high school. I realized that my life has been completely changed because of TASSEL. When I spent one year with TASSEL, I learned so many things and I could say that so many children improved a lot as well. In TASSEL, I felt like everyone was my family because they cared so much and I also feel like TASSEL is my second home. The actions in TASSEL are almost the same as what my father told me, that I have to be intelligent, kind, friendly, and helpful. Those traits are what I myself wanted to do when I grew up. I also want to keep on doing good things to serve other poor people through TASSEL because I know how hard and difficult it is to live.</p>
                    <p>TASSEL is the place where students go to learn English from their teachers. TASSEL does not only teach English to the kids but also loves, cares and serves them through our hearts. I feel extremely happy because of TASSEL, nowadays I receive so much love from everyone around me. Now I see what the right things that TASSEL does are. I am so thankful that I have a lot of role models in TASSEL so that can learn to change my life. Last but not least, if I had a lot of money, I would build some schools in other areas in order to help teach the poor children without charging money like what TASSEL does because I truly believe that education is the only way to change my country.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Sarem</h1>
                    <p>I am Sarem and my father is Ram. My full name is Sarem Ram. I am 32 years old. I was born in 1987 in a small village called Kampong Chamlorng, Banan District, Battambang Province. My mother gave birth to seven children; one daughter and six sons, including me. I am fourth among my siblings. My parents are farmers. They work under the hot sun to support our livings. My family moved to Jeepan when I was ten years old. We moved because of family situations. When we were in Kampong Chamlorng, my parents could not earn for a living by growing crops on a very small farm behind the house. Many problems occurred. There were too many insects destroying the crops and we were unable to afford pesticides and fertilizer, the soil was not rich, crops did not grow well, there was a lack of jobs, and there were many children in the family. Those were clear reasons as to why my family moved to Jeepan, the village where my family and I used to live in a dense forest, the place where I used to be a bushman, the place without a toilet, with no clean water, no clean food, no electricity, no music at night except frogs, toads, and insects’ crying every night. Despite this,, it was a memorable place where I grew up and started to see the new world in my life.</p>
                    <p>Life before TASSEL. It was like a dark world in my mind. My life was full of problems. I did not have enough food and the food that I had was not nutritious for my health. I just ate to satisfy my sad stomach and although I knew the food was not clean or safe, I had no choice. As a result of that diet, my brain and health were affected. I was sick very often. My brain did not work well and I kept losing my memory. It took so long for me to memorize a short lesson. I could not get good grades and as a result, I failed my 12th-grade exam. I was about to choose to die for my suffering life. I could not believe that I had failed. The family situations were bad, but my 12th-grade exam result was even worse. I was on the fence, I did not know what to do next. I was a very hopeless man and I was so ashamed to go to school again. I had seen so many selfish people. Teachers charged students a lot of money through giving some extra classes. Students cheated on exams. Those who joined the extra classes got good grades, they got answers from the teachers beforehand. I was ignored, hated by other teachers because I did not have any money for them. I became a very lonely man at the time. Instead of going to attend the extra classes that I could not afford, I spent a lot of time reading books and asking other students questions that I did not understand or know the answers to. I liked asking questions to the students who went to the extra classes because they had learned a lot more from the teachers. I knew it took time, and when other students thought I bothered them. I used to say “sorry” and go away when they were unhappy to answer my questions. Fortunately, with my best efforts, I passed the 12th-grade exam in 2009. I cried because I could not believe that I had achieved my dream.</p>
                    <p>Life at TASSEL. About four years ago, I talked to Teacher Joji, Teacher Noeng, and Teacher Samath. I talked to them about the situations of the villagers, especially the children and old people. I grew up in Jeepan and I have known and understood clearly the call for help from the village. I taught the students at TASSEL Rattinak five years ago, and also at TASSEL Samrang. I have seen with my own eyes how much love, hope, and care that TASSEL has done to change Cambodia and its people. TASSEL is not only for an English education but also for transforming people’s hearts. I have learned so much from TASSEL volunteers (high school students and adults). I am a teacher for my students, but also a student for my personal teachers. In the summer, the TASSEL volunteers come to teach Cambodian teachers and students in local villages. They do family visits. They try to learn, understand, and serve the poor in this country. TASSEL is all about the heart. TASSEL transforms from one’s heart to thousands’. TASSEL serves the poor who desperately need help. TASSEL gives love to suffering people. TASSEL is a very good family for the poor. I have received a lot of love since I started working with TASSEL. I have become more responsible, helpful, patient, generous, thankful, grateful, sensitive, and positive because of TASSEL. I can bring a lot of help to the children and villagers through TASSEL. The villagers’ hearts have been transformed through the love, care, hope, and education that TASSEL has been giving from the very beginning. As an example, my father, Ram, gave a piece of land to TASSEL. He helped build classrooms for TASSEL for free. His heart was obviously transformed because he has seen how great TASSEL is. The children in my village have the opportunity to study English for free. The people who are starving can eat better now. Sick people can get help with medical treatments. TASSEL changes people in a very special way that other organizations cannot do. Through TASSEL, I got the answer to my question “How can the poor help the poor?” It does not matter how small or big the help and love you give to the poor is. Every success and change come from your pure heart!</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Sokvi</h1>
                    <p>My name is Sokvi Non; I was born in 1987(I am 32). My parents and all of my siblings live in Sdukbrovoek Village, Sdukbrovoek Commune, Moung Russey District, Battambang Province, Cambodia. There are eight people in my family, and I have six siblings (three sisters and three brothers). I am the second child. My father is a farmer, and my mother is a housewife. My oldest brother decided to drop out when he was 14 because he wanted to help my family. He was just in grade 2, and we were so poor at the time that we did not have enough rice to eat sometimes. My brother loved feeding cows very much. So my parents decided to ask for neighbors’ cows to feed. One of the neighbors provided us with two cows, which made my brother, Sovan, very delighted. He got married when he was 21, and he has four children now. One of my sisters had decided to drop out when she was in grade 5. Her name is Channy, she was my first younger sister, and I found that she was very smart, for she always was first or second in the class among forty-five students. Unfortunately, she had made up her mind to drop out because she wanted to work in Thailand to help earn money to support our family. My younger brother also dropped out when he was in grade 4. My two youngest sisters decided to drop out when they were studying in the Secondary School (8th grade), because they wanted to work in Thailand to help earn money as well. My parents and I could not stop them because they thought that “The more they learned, the more money they spent”; unfortunately, my parents were not able to support them. Now most of them are working in Thailand, they are all married.</p>
                    <p>I had left my own family to live with my aunt, my mother's sister when I was in grade 2. I was just 14 at the time. My aunt was married to a well-educated man, so her family’s living conditions were better than mine. I had to take care of my aunt’s cows; I also worked as a farmer. Fortunately, my aunt was very kind and friendly, and she always encouraged me to study. Although I could study, my knowledge did not improve much due to the lack of schooling; I lived in a rural area. I wanted to study English; unfortunately, I could not because I was not able to find an English school in my village and I could not move to study in the city because I was super busy herding the cows. I wished to learn more English, and I always hoped that I could go to study in the city one day because I became so happy when I saw my uncle speaking English with foreigners. I graduated from university because of my kind aunt and uncle. I am luckier than all my siblings because I was able to finish college. I studied at a university in Battambang Province and graduated in 2014. I have had experience teaching English for almost seven years up to the present.  Before I joined TASSEL, I had worked for private schools. I found that the privileged children did not need me because they had enough money to find good schools, so I decided not to work for a private school anymore. After that, I had made up my mind to work with TASSEL. I applied for a job in TASSEL and passed my interview to work for it. After I had worked with TASSEL for two months, I got married on 22nd February 2019. I have been working with TASSEL for almost a year now.</p>
                    <p>The reason why I decided to work with TASSEL is that it is an organization that has been working to help poor children and families throughout rural areas without discrimination. I have found that TASSEL has been working to provide the high quality of English programs to the children in the rural areas which need English education. Besides teaching English, TASSEL has also offered rice and some medicines to impoverished families. All of the TASSEL staff have been working very hard for the poor; also, TASSEL staff have been helping sick people by sending them to hospitals. While they are teaching the children in class, they need to put their work aside when they know that there are sick people who need to be sent to the hospital. TASSEL has been working as a family; all staff from the topmost to the lowest levels have been working together like siblings. We love each other very much, for we have the same willingness. For me, I have had my purpose that I wanted to help develop my community since I was young. I think that I will use my existing knowledge that I have learned from school to share with others, especially the poor. My purpose is that if I had a lot of money, I would build a school to help teach English to the poor without charging money from them. As in my own experience, I had no English schooling until I started attempting to study in high school.  So my English knowledge was very poor when I started university. Now, I feel so happy that I can work with TASSEL to provide the English knowledge to the poor. The next generation will not get worse like mine did because they can improve their knowledge by studying with TASSEL. They can get English classes not only with Khmer Teachers but also with foreign teachers, for TASSEL has a lot of kind foreigners helping to teach the children. So, I dare to say that the TASSEL is the best organization for developing or changing Cambodia by creating the best education system for Cambodian children. TASSEL has not only been providing real knowledge to the children but also provided hope to them. I love TASSEL.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Tharam</h1>
                    <p>My name is Tharam, and I was born on February 17, 1995, in Battambang, Cambodia. I am the second of  four children in my family. When I was five years old, my parents moved to a forest that was only five kilometers away from the community, and it was very quiet and dangerous​​ with vicious animals and landmines. Despite the dangers, my parents were never afraid of them; they wanted to change their lives. After a few months, I was ill with a serious condition. I couldn’t even speak and move like other children. Even my family used to think that I may not be able to speak. Therefore, they had to send me back to live with my grandmother in the village. When I was seven, my life became better and better. I could go to school with my neighbors, who became my best friends then. We walked to school, but it was fun because we liked playing with my friends along the way to school. After school, I went to tend cattle with my villagers, even though I didn’t have any buffaloes or cows. I went just for fun. I liked staying with friends and making them laugh. We all loved each other so much. I finished elementary school, attended Secondary school, and the worst memories came - four of my friends failed, another dropped out of school, and only three people became students there. We went to the same school, but not the same class, except one. Five months later, Sin, who was my classmate, dropped out. Due to this, I had to sit by myself in class for a year. Eighth grade came, and my best friend, Toch, drowned in the lake when he went to his relative’s funeral. I remember the last words he said to me the day before, which was, “If I die, will you cry?” I told him nothing. It became the worst thing I had ever faced in my whole life. After his death, I was afraid to make new friends for years. My grandmother also died that year because of illness, leaving me alone. Thus, I had to live by myself while attending school alone, as all my best friends gave it up. It was only me who had an opportunity to study in high school.</p>
                    <p>Time never stops, and we couldn’t control it. Not only the good things became our memories, but so did the bad stories. Somehow, I think I am luckier than some of my friends. After I graduated high school, I had a chance to educate myself in a university. Despite this, I cannot forget everything in the past, and it is still in my mind. These problems still happen; most of the poor kids drop out of school for their parents can’t support their studies. For years, the villagers have had no rice to eat. Some of the rice fields were empty. It rained for only a short while, and then it stopped completely. Due to this, the farmers have to leave their farms and go to Thailand. Even if the rain is enough, the agricultural laborers still leave the country because the yields are cheap.​​ It seems as though they do it only for trading. Due to these issues, I wanted to do something to fix it, but I couldn’t. In the second year, I found out the best way to solve these issues, joining TASSEL, a place I can dream of helping poor children and the people with nothing. TASSEL gives me a chance to help the young, the old, and myself. Although my English is not perfect, I want to share it with children and tell them to be good citizens. Even years into the future, I still want to be a part of TASSEL. I want the kids to be able to stay with their friends, families, and people around them until they die. My childhood was not so good, but I hope the next generations will be better.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Angkear</h1>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Angkear. I am 25 years old. I just graduated from university this year. I have two sisters and have no brothers. Nowadays, I live only with my mom because both of my sisters got married and moved away from home. My dad left the family since I was a baby. My mom was the only person who took care of me and my sisters. In my family, I am the only one who had the chance to receive higher education. Because of poverty, my oldest sister quit school when she was in sixth grade to take care of me and helped my mother earn money by helping the neighbor harvest rice. Day by day, our lives became worse and worse, which led my second sister to quit school to start earning money for the family, too.</p>
                    <p>Growing up in a poor and broken family really has taught me a lot of lessons about life which I couldn’t learn from school and it was an unforgettable lesson for me. This helps me understand the feeling of the poor very easily. I have experienced suffering, sadness, and neglect. Before, I wanted to give up at times because life was so challenging for me, and it was so unfair for me to be born in that situation, but everything has changed since I joined TASSEL.</p>
                    <p>I have been working with TASSEL since 2015. Since I started working at this organization, I realized that my life has completely changed. I am loved and cared for by many people, especially by the TASSEL family.  Moreover, I have learned even more from life. In addition, I have the chance to be involved with people who are very poor and are suffering. Also, I can directly share my experience and knowledge with my poor Cambodian children and motivate them to have hope although life is so difficult for them. When I was a child, I used to think that maybe my situation was the worst, but that was not true at all. At least I have my responsible mother who never left me and still takes care of me. In contrast, some of my poor students do not even have food to eat, and some children do not even know their parents. Furthermore, most of them are really hopeless. I can feel how they feel about their situations. I am so happy and thankful that TASSEL exists in Cambodia to serve the poor, and I am also happy that I can be a part of this cause.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Samath</h1>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Samath, and I am 26 years-old. I was born into a very poor family in Snoeng, which is where one of the TASSEL schools is currently located. I am the youngest of three siblings, and within my whole family I am the only one with a college degree. None of my relatives have finished grade 9.</p>
                    <p>For 6 years, while I was in elementary school, I would walk to school. During my secondary education I spent most of my time taking care of cows at the rice fields, so I didn’t have much time to study at home. As a result, I often brought my books to the fields and studied while taking care of the cows. During the rainy season (June - October), I frequently caught fish, snails, frogs, and veregable for food, sometimes even staying overnight so that I could catch more things. Sometimes I would sell the things I found so I had money to buy school supplies. Every year between January to March my mother and I spent all day at the fields to pick up any tammarine leaves and rice that was left over from the harvest to make some money.</p>
                    <p>When I finished secondary school, my parents sold a cow to get some money so I could enroll in high school in the city. I had to bribe the school’s headmaster to let me in to the school. I remember before I moved to the city my dad said, “No matter what it takes, I will help you get an education.” The motivation I received from those words made me try harder in high school. Before I went to high school I thought life would be much happier because of all the opportunities in the city; however, everything was completely different from what I thought. The time I spent in high school was the hardest time of my life; many of my teachers were selfish and cared only about the students who would pay them for private classes. Since I didn’t have the money to take private classes I was left out. A few times my teachers failed me because I wan’t taking theirs classes, and most teachers didn’t teach what they needed to in class so that students would take their classes. The attitude of the teachers disgusted me, and this was the time that made me want to be a teacher, but to be a different teacher from those.</p>
                    <p>In 2012, after I graduated from high school, I went to a public university where I met some new people who introduced me to an NGO called CHo where I met Teacher Noeng and Teacher Joji. Since I wanted to be a teacher, I started teaching at CHO to gain experience. Fortunately, while working with CHO I got to know teacher Joji better, which lead to me being involved in TASSEL.</p>
                    <p>I have worked with TASSEL for 7 years and I can say that TASSEL is completely unique. What TASSEL is working to achieve is incredible, and I am so thankful that I got to know Teacher Joji, who is my number one role model. If it weren’t for him, TASSEL would not exist, and all of the amazing things that have come out of TASSEL would not have happened.</p>
                    <p>My goal as a TASSEL teacher is to help poor children, because I have been in their situation before. I understand how it feels to not have enough love from teachers, so I want to stop the bad attitude from my generation and show love. TASSEL is like a family to all of our students and villagers. We give them love, care, and help so that they know they are cared for. To me, seeing the poor and the villagers receiving all this help and love is one of the happiest things in my life. I truly believe that TASSEL will change my country into a place where people do not suffer.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Kimdin</h1>
                    <p>My name is Dol KimDin, and I am 32 years old. I was born in Trang Village, Me Tuek Commune, Bakan District, Pursat Province, Cambodia. I have eight members in my family, and I am the fourth child in the family. I have three brothers and three sisters. All of my sisters and brothers got married except me. I grew up in a poor family. My hometown is very far from the town, and is located in a remote area. My village is very far from the hospital, so when the villagers get sick, it’s difficult for them to see a doctor. When I was a child, I used to sleep on the boat with my oldest brother at night. Sometimes it was stormy while I was sleeping, and my oldest brother would wake me up to take a boat into the middle of the forest to get rid of risks from the storm. Sometimes, we could not sleep for the whole night and sat on the boat until the sunrise. I often felt cold as well. Usually, I slept for two or three hours each night, then I would get up at 3AM to catch fish and bring them to my mother. She then sold them so that she could buy some rice and medicine for my whole family. I went to school with my friends, but most of the time, I came to school very late because I was busy with my difficult job. After finishing the lessons, I used to harvest/cut grass in deep water to feed some buffalos in the rice fields. I spent many years working on boats. During the dry season, my parents, my siblings and I usually went on a cart pulled by our buffalo to pick morning glory to sell at market for buying rice.</p>
                    <p>In 2004, when I was 15 years old, I asked my parents if I could become a monk. Why did I want to be a monk? I had three reasons. Firstly, I wanted to study the Buddha’s teaching because when I was young, I used to listen to the monk preaching. It made me so faithful in Buddhism and my parents let me became a temple boy at the end of 2003. I ordained as a novice in 2004.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, I needed a chance to enter school like other children. At that time, I wanted to study full time. I thought only education can change my life to be better. So I decided to become a monk and stayed at Wat Trang (Trang monastery). I studied only the Dammar for six years. At the end of 2009, I moved to Battambang Province. I had the chance to study in high school and English classes at Association For Knowledge Development non-organization (AKD). I got basic knowledge of English from this school.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, after I associated with some temple boys and listened to the Dharma, it made me want to be a monk because I really loved the monks’ life, which is well-disciplined and trained their mind. On May 10, 2019, I decided to disrobe from the monk because I wanted to change my life and want to get new experiences from my new way of life.</p>
                    <p>All of these are my own life experiences. I always encountered many problems but I never gave up. Even though I have been sick, I have been trying to help my poor children. I have known the feeling of children who live in remote areas like I did. I will educate them to make their lives better.</p>
