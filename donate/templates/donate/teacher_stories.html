                    <h1>Teacher Samnieng</h1>
                    <p>My name is Samnieng. I am 27 years old. I have four siblings (three brothers and one sister). I am the oldest child in my family. My father is a landmine victim. He can’t work well. Throughout my childhood, I had to work and help my father’s work. I used to work at a construction site when I needed some money to support my studies. I started learning English when I was in high school. It was very difficult for me because I was an adult who studied with children. Life was not easy during that time. I had to work hard to earn money by myself. There were also a lot of people in my family and my mother could not support my brothers and me very well. Sometimes I had no money to pay for my English school. I had to beg my English teacher to excuse me from paying the school fees for one or two months. After I graduated from high school, I was happy but I was also hopeless because I had no money to study at university. I tried to apply for scholarships from universities in my province, but I didn’t get any. I felt so hopeless with my life. Finally, one of my friends told me about scholarship programs at Dewey International University. I passed a test at Dewey and paid one hundred dollars per year. Dewey is where I met Teacher Neong, Teacher Phyrom, and Teacher Sarem.</p>
                    <p>When I was at university, I wanted to work as a businessman because I thought that being rich could change someone’s life. I decided to work in a private school, but I felt so hopeless because they cared only about rich students and not about the quality of education. At that time, I decided to stop working in that private school and then started to work for an NGO. I thought that working in the NGO would let me help the poor, but in fact, it didn’t. There were many corrupt NGOs in Cambodia that only wanted to get more money from foreigners. I was stressed because this was different from my goal, which was to help the poor. During that time, Teacher Noeng talked to me about TASSEL. I trusted Teacher Noeng because he was my classmate.</p>
                    <p> I have been working with TASSEL for 5 years and am still very happy with TASSEL because I can help more poor people. TASSEL’s specific mission is very different from what I know of other NGOs. TASSEL teachers are like my brothers and sisters. They always help me when I have a problem, they always motivate me when I feel hopeless, and they always show me what is good and what is bad. TASSEL students are cute and good students. They respect and listen to the teachers. They study to work hard everyday. I feel so happy when I teach TASSEL students. They always motivate me to work harder and harder. They are a good next generation for Cambodia. The TASSEL program is good. All the teachers must train before they teach their students. Some of them are allowed to train with foreign teachers. TASSEL focuses on the quality of education, That is why all the teachers train every day with foreign teachers and Khmer leaders. TASSEL’s love is the most important thing in transforming people’s hearts. I love the way TASSEL explains to the students and I hope in the future all children and people will love and help each other. Finally, TASSEL is the best organization that can help poor people and change their hearts. I hope all foreigners will continue to help and support us forever.</p>

                <div>
                    <h1>Teacher Vanna</h1>
                    <p>My name is Hut Vanna. I’m from Cambodia. I was born in Siem Reap Province, Kralanh District. My birthday is on September 2nd. I have five siblings in my family: four brothers and one sister. Unfortunately, eight years ago, when I was 18, my older brother—the fifth child— drowned. So, now I have only four siblings. My life has been full of struggles and challenges. My father passed away when I was only 6 months old. I remember when I was 7 years old, my mum played an important role among the 6 of us children. She worked tirelessly for us; she started a small shop to sell fish and different kinds of vegetables in order to earn money to support us and provide us the opportunity to study in primary school. Realizing the burden that our mum carried, my brothers, sister, and I also worked extremely hard. We often went to rice fields to catch fish to sell. I was always so happy when I caught lots of fish. Some of my favorite foods when I was younger were crickets, snakes, snails, and spiders; I loved to eat them the most.</p>
                    <p>When I turned ten years old, my mum had no ability to help us anymore due to her illness. My older brothers moved to Thailand to work as construction workers and my older sister moved to a rural area called Samlot, where the Khmer Rouge ended, and she took me along with her. My sister and I got there in 2004. We both stayed with my aunt, who was a former Khmer Rouge soldier. She was very kind to me. However, life was very difficult in Samlot. My sister and I worked hard on the farm; we grew green beans, peanuts, and cassavas to earn our living. However, unluckily, a big flood completely damaged my sister’s crops one year. Having no other way to continue paying the money we owed to microfinance companies annually, I decided that I needed to drop out of ninth grade and move to Thailand to earn money. Once there, I stayed with my older brother who was married with two children. My job was to sell water and sweep trash around parking lots near the Khmer-Thai border. I worked very hard there, and I was able to send some money to my sister and my mum every month.</p>
                    <p>Two years later, I had to make a decision on whether or not I should go back to school the following year. After long contemplation, I realized that education was necessary for my life, so I asked my sister if I could restart my ninth grade. She agreed to my request, but she struggled to earn enough to help me achieve my goal. After I finished 9th grade, I went to Battambanng to continue high school education. After I graduated from high school in 2015, I applied for a Scholarship at Dewey International University. Fortunately, I got a full-ride scholarship. At that time I felt relieved because I didn’t have to pay for the school fees. When I was a freshman, I took time to work in catering at a restaurant. I did not only serve food, but also cooked for the customers. That’s why I am good at cooking now. I worked for that restaurant for one and a half years, but I later quit that job because the shop owner required me to work from 5PM - 1AM  every day, which was impossible for me because I needed more time to study on weekends. Therefore, soon after, I began working for a hotel in Battambang city for one year. I had a lot of responsibilities, but I loved my job because the owner taught me many things. While I was working at the hotel, I heard from two friends—Teacher Dalin and Teacher Sakana—  about TASSEL.</p>
                    <p>After I got to know what TASSEL was about, I became very interested and quickly applied to become an English teacher at TASSEL. I have been with TASSEL for one year now, and TASSEL has transformed me. TASSEL gives me love and teaches me to share love with others.  TASSEL not only loves the poor in Cambodia but also helps them. Honestly speaking, the TASSEL teachers are extremely kind to me. They have taught me from their heart. I can’t believe that such kind human beings exist. To me, TASSEL plays an important role in saving lives.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Sakana</h1>
                    <p>My name is Sakana. I was born in 1963, and I am 26 years-old. I have four sisters. When I was five years old my three year old brother drowned. Losing him caused my parents and I a lot of sadness. When I was 6 years old I started first grade. I studied at Snoeng primary school. At the time my family was very poor, we had food in the morning, but rarely in the evening.</p>
                    <p>When I was in grade 11 I went to Thailand to start working as a construction worker. My job was to fix roads in Thailand, and I ended up working there for three months because I needed to help my family. Unfortunately, my boss did not pay me, so I went back to Cambodia. After returning I started twelfth grade, which was were I first discovered TASSEL. One day I met a person who was very kind and friendly, he was Teacher Joji. I asked him if I could be a TASSEL teacher and he said yes.</p>
                    <p>I have been working with TASSEL for four years. I believe that TASSEL is a very good organization in the for the poor in cambodia. TASSEL not only teaches English to poor children, but it also provides other forms of help for the children. TASSEL has been a great opportunity, I love teaching the kids and I understand their situations because my family is also poor. The students do not have money to attend private schools, but they can attend TASSEL which is a school in the countryside. The students can learn English without having to pay and they are taught by so many kind and friendly foreign teachers who teach English to the children over Vsee every year. Moreover, these teachers visit my country every summer. They give clothes to the kids, medicine to the old people, and they teach English to children. The foreign TASSEL teachers always care, love, and share that love with the Cambodians. I strongly believe that Cambodia will change because we have the kindest people helping us, and we can be better with English education.</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Sarem</h1>
                    <p>I am Sarem and my father is Ram. My full name is Sarem Ram. I am 32 years old. I was born in 1987 in a small village called Kampong Chamlorng, Banan District, Battambang Province. My mother gave birth to seven children; one daughter and six sons, including me. I am fourth among my siblings. My parents are farmers. They work under the hot sun to support our livings. My family moved to Jeepan when I was ten years old. We moved because of family situations. When we were in Kampong Chamlorng, my parents could not earn for a living by growing crops on a very small farm behind the house. Many problems occurred. There were too many insects destroying the crops and we were unable to afford pesticides and fertilizer, the soil was not rich, crops did not grow well, there was a lack of jobs, and there were many children in the family. Those were clear reasons as to why my family moved to Jeepan, the village where my family and I used to live in a dense forest, the place where I used to be a bushman, the place without a toilet, with no clean water, no clean food, no electricity, no music at night except frogs, toads, and insects’ crying every night. Despite this,, it was a memorable place where I grew up and started to see the new world in my life.</p>
                    <p>Life before TASSEL. It was like a dark world in my mind. My life was full of problems. I did not have enough food and the food that I had was not nutritious for my health. I just ate to satisfy my sad stomach and although I knew the food was not clean or safe, I had no choice. As a result of that diet, my brain and health were affected. I was sick very often. My brain did not work well and I kept losing my memory. It took so long for me to memorize a short lesson. I could not get good grades and as a result, I failed my 12th-grade exam. I was about to choose to die for my suffering life. I could not believe that I had failed. The family situations were bad, but my 12th-grade exam result was even worse. I was on the fence, I did not know what to do next. I was a very hopeless man and I was so ashamed to go to school again. I had seen so many selfish people. Teachers charged students a lot of money through giving some extra classes. Students cheated on exams. Those who joined the extra classes got good grades, they got answers from the teachers beforehand. I was ignored, hated by other teachers because I did not have any money for them. I became a very lonely man at the time. Instead of going to attend the extra classes that I could not afford, I spent a lot of time reading books and asking other students questions that I did not understand or know the answers to. I liked asking questions to the students who went to the extra classes because they had learned a lot more from the teachers. I knew it took time, and when other students thought I bothered them. I used to say “sorry” and go away when they were unhappy to answer my questions. Fortunately, with my best efforts, I passed the 12th-grade exam in 2009. I cried because I could not believe that I had achieved my dream.</p>
                    <p>Life at TASSEL. About four years ago, I talked to Teacher Joji, Teacher Noeng, and Teacher Samath. I talked to them about the situations of the villagers, especially the children and old people. I grew up in Jeepan and I have known and understood clearly the call for help from the village. I taught the students at TASSEL Rattinak five years ago, and also at TASSEL Samrang. I have seen with my own eyes how much love, hope, and care that TASSEL has done to change Cambodia and its people. TASSEL is not only for an English education but also for transforming people’s hearts. I have learned so much from TASSEL volunteers (high school students and adults). I am a teacher for my students, but also a student for my personal teachers. In the summer, the TASSEL volunteers come to teach Cambodian teachers and students in local villages. They do family visits. They try to learn, understand, and serve the poor in this country. TASSEL is all about the heart. TASSEL transforms from one’s heart to thousands’. TASSEL serves the poor who desperately need help. TASSEL gives love to suffering people. TASSEL is a very good family for the poor. I have received a lot of love since I started working with TASSEL. I have become more responsible, helpful, patient, generous, thankful, grateful, sensitive, and positive because of TASSEL. I can bring a lot of help to the children and villagers through TASSEL. The villagers’ hearts have been transformed through the love, care, hope, and education that TASSEL has been giving from the very beginning. As an example, my father, Ram, gave a piece of land to TASSEL. He helped build classrooms for TASSEL for free. His heart was obviously transformed because he has seen how great TASSEL is. The children in my village have the opportunity to study English for free. The people who are starving can eat better now. Sick people can get help with medical treatments. TASSEL changes people in a very special way that other organizations cannot do. Through TASSEL, I got the answer to my question “How can the poor help the poor?” It does not matter how small or big the help and love you give to the poor is. Every success and change come from your pure heart!</p>

                    <h1>Teacher Angkear</h1>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Angkear. I am 25 years old. I just graduated from university this year. I have two sisters and have no brothers. Nowadays, I live only with my mom because both of my sisters got married and moved away from home. My dad left the family since I was a baby. My mom was the only person who took care of me and my sisters. In my family, I am the only one who had the chance to receive higher education. Because of poverty, my oldest sister quit school when she was in sixth grade to take care of me and helped my mother earn money by helping the neighbor harvest rice. Day by day, our lives became worse and worse, which led my second sister to quit school to start earning money for the family, too.</p>
                    <p>Growing up in a poor and broken family really has taught me a lot of lessons about life which I couldn’t learn from school and it was an unforgettable lesson for me. This helps me understand the feeling of the poor very easily. I have experienced suffering, sadness, and neglect. Before, I wanted to give up at times because life was so challenging for me, and it was so unfair for me to be born in that situation, but everything has changed since I joined TASSEL.</p>
                    <p>I have been working with TASSEL since 2015. Since I started working at this organization, I realized that my life has completely changed. I am loved and cared for by many people, especially by the TASSEL family.  Moreover, I have learned even more from life. In addition, I have the chance to be involved with people who are very poor and are suffering. Also, I can directly share my experience and knowledge with my poor Cambodian children and motivate them to have hope although life is so difficult for them. When I was a child, I used to think that maybe my situation was the worst, but that was not true at all. At least I have my responsible mother who never left me and still takes care of me. In contrast, some of my poor students do not even have food to eat, and some children do not even know their parents. Furthermore, most of them are really hopeless. I can feel how they feel about their situations. I am so happy and thankful that TASSEL exists in Cambodia to serve the poor, and I am also happy that I can be a part of this cause.</p>
